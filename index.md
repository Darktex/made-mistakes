Oh hey --- I'm Michael Rose, just another bearded, tattooed, time traveling, designer slash illustrator working in Buffalo, New York. 

Most of my day is spent manipulating type and image to produce marketing materials and print catalogs. I'm also into drawing [faceless portraits of strangers]({{ site.url }}/articles/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project.html) via the interweb and an iPad, movie theater popcorn, chicken wings, and over using ellipses and em-dashes.

Lately I've started "blogging" about my drawing and painting techniques using the Paper iPad app --- which you can find below.
