## Setup

### Jekyll

The following terminal command will install Jekyll and any required RubyGems if you have [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) installed.

``` bash
$ bundle install
```

Or you can just install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) via [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/)

``` bash
$ gem install jekyll

```
### Jekyll Plugins

The only plugin that needs installing is the [Jekyll-minibundle](https://github.com/tkareine/jekyll-minibundle) RubyGem.The other plugins are already installed in the `_plugins` folder and should be set to go. 

#### [Jekyll-minibundle](https://github.com/tkareine/jekyll-minibundle)

This plugin requires Ruby 1.9.3 so if you don't want to use it just remove the `{% ministamp %}` Liquid tags in `head.html` and `scripts.html`.

To install Jekyll-minibundle use the following terminal command:
``` bash
$ gem install jekyll-minibundle
```

#### [related_posts](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/related_posts-jekyll_plugin)

Overrides the built in related_posts function to calculate related posts based on a postsâ€™ tags. Used in `article.html` layout.

#### [Sitemap.xml Generator](http://www.kinnetica.com/projects/jekyll-sitemap-generator/)

Generates a `sitemap.xml` file by traversing all of the available posts and pages.

#### svg_mime_type

Serves SVG files with the correct MIME type when running `$ jekyll --server`.

### Useful Commands

Run Jekyll:
``` bash
$ jekyll
```

Start a Jekyll server at <http://localhost:4000/>, (make sure to enable this url in `_config.yml` so all assets and images have correct absolute url's via the `{{ site.url }}` Liquid tag:
``` bash
$ jekyll --server

Minify all .html files in `_site` folder using HTML-compressor:
``` bash
$ rake minify
```

### Deployment

Nothing fancy here.

1. Enable correct `{{ site.url }}` in `_config.yml` (ie: http://mademistakes.com)
2. Run Jekyll `$ jekyll`
3. Minify HTML `$ rake minify`
4. FTP the contents of the `_site` folder to your webserver
