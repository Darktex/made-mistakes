<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_kp5y8wVeeL1qz8pllo1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>So I decided to brew my favorite green tea (<a href="http://www.adagio.com/green/citron_green.html?SID=2f881ce725a03304245c352ea95a3dc3" target="_blank">Citron Green from Adagio</a>), to see if it would taste as flavorful in iced beverage mode. Most likely it&#8217;ll be similiar to cold piss, but who knows maybe I&#8217;m in for a surprise. Should know shortly once it&#8217;s done chilling out in the fridge.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Taste is ok but it&#8217;s pretty watered down. Need to add more leaf next time.</p>
