<p>Three days later I&#8217;m still impressed with the <b>Palm Pre</b>. As a user of Palm OS smartphones (<b>Treo 600</b>, <b>Treo 650</b>, <b>Centro</b>), I&#8217;ve come to rely on a proven feature set. The experience of having a device that organizes your life, makes phone calls, and connects online—has remained unchanged. For the most part the <b>Palm Pre</b> meets or exceeds my expectations, with only a few minor back steps. After the break is a full rundown of my Palm Pre likes and dislikes (mostly software related), in no particular order.<br/><img title="Palm Pre closed with my sweet wallpaper" src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/355.jpg" alt="Palm Pre closed" width="500" height="333"/><br/><br/><b>Palm Pre positives</b></p>

<ul><li> Device feels great in your hands. <i>(Not sure where all the &#8220;it feels cheap&#8221; reviews came from)</i></li>

<li> Screen looks awesome!</li>

<li> The design of the User Interface is amazing!!</li>

<li> webOS is very responsive and allows <b>true multitasking</b>.</li>

<li> Notifications are handled very elegantly.</li>

<li>Push Gmail. <i>(Emails hit my Palm Pre before my desktop&#8230;sweet!)</i></li>

<li> Synergy and the way that it syncs with &#8220;the cloud&#8221;. <i>(ie: Google, Facebook, etc)</i></li>

<li> Battery life. <i>(I can easily make it through a workday which is all I had hoped for)</i></li>

<li> Removable battery.</li>

<li> Physical keyboard. <i>(Yes it&#8217;s small, but coming from a Centro I have no problems banging out txt&#8217;s or emails)</i></li>

<li> Plugging in via USB let&#8217;s you access the ringtone and wallpaper folders, to easily add your own to the device.</li>

<li> Is capable of syncing with iTunes to add music, podcasts, videos, movies, or photos.</li>

<li> Backups every day to your Palm Profile—just in case you need to restore your device after a wipe.</li>

<li> GPS and Sprint Navigation for turn by turn directions.</li>

</ul><p><b>Palm Pre negatives</b></p>

<ul><li> Having to pay $30 for the Classic app. Booooooooo!</li>

<li> Having to use Classic at all! Let&#8217;s get true webOS versions on the App Catalog so I can stop using Classic for a few archaic applications.</li>

<li> No option to make <i>Tasks repeatable</i> like the Palm OS version. <i>(Maybe I&#8217;m the only one who relies on this&#8230;I dunno)</i></li>

<li> Tasks don&#8217;t sync up with Google Tasks. <i>(I&#8217;m sure this will happen eventually)</i></li>

<li> Flipping through the Calendar is painfully slow.</li>

<li> No agenda view in Calendar.</li>

<li> Sprint Navigation doesn&#8217;t pull in your contacts&#8217; addresses if they&#8217;re coming from Google or Facebook accounts.</li>

<li> Can&#8217;t change the notification sound. <i>(I have no desire to change it but it would be nice to have the option)</i></li>

<li> Can&#8217;t assign a default ringtone for unknown callers like in Palm OS devices.</li>

<li> Reception issues. <i>(I&#8217;ve never had more than 2 bars at my house with the <b>Centro</b>, but the Palm Pre seems to average much less and I&#8217;ve experienced a few dropped calls)</i></li>

<li>Landscape mode is limited to only a few applications</li>

<li> USB port cover seems cheaply made and I feel like I&#8217;m going to break it off every time I open it.</li>

<li> Device does get warm after prolonged usage. <i>(To be fair so did my Centro)</i></li>

<li> Speaker isn&#8217;t that loud.</li>

</ul><p>So there you have it. Can&#8217;t say that I was excited about the thought of paying an extra $20 a month for the required Sprint Everything Data plan. But seeing how I&#8217;m getting more anytime minutes, Sprint Navigation, Sprint TV, and nights that start at 7pm instead of 9pm—I&#8217;ll live. My only real Palm Pre complaints stem from it&#8217;s software or lack of applications, which I&#8217;m pretty confident will be addressed with future firmware and software updates. I hope ;-)<br/><br/>If you&#8217;re looking for a more in-depth look at the Palm Pre, check out <a href="http://www.precentral.net/palm-pre-review" target="_blank">Precentral&#8217;s extensive review</a>.
