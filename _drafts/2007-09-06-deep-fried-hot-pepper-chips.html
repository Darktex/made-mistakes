<p>Not sure what these are really called or if anyone has coined a name for them&#8230;but they&#8217;re a great little snack. Back before I was into hot and spicy foods, I remember my dad making these and stinking up the house with peppers. They&#8217;re basically dried out banana or hot peppers that you then deep fry for a second to make crispy like a potato chip. Eat two or three of them and your mouth will be on fire. If you&#8217;ve ever sprinkled crushed red pepper onto your pizza at an Italian restaurant then you know the taste.<br/><br/>Really simply to make.<br/></p><ol><br/><li>Freshly grown peppers from the garden work great. The best ones to use are long and thin ones like banana peppers (not sure if a bell pepper would work since they&#8217;re quite thick). Wash them throughly.</li><br/><li>Drying out the peppers is easy. You can either hang them by a string and let them sit for a month while they shrivel up and harden or place them in a <a href="http://www.nextag.com/fruit-dehydrator/search-html" target="_blank">fruit dehydrator</a> and do it over night. When the peppers turn all wrinkly and are stiff they&#8217;re ready to deep fry.</li><br/><li>Cut the tops off and clean out all the seeds inside. I usually cut down the middle a ways so I can get at the seeds easily. Make sure to wash your hands after handling the peppers. I&#8217;ve made the mistake of rubbing my eyes and burning the hell out of them. Ouch.</li><br/><li>Deep fry for a second—stick them in pull them out. They will burn really fast so you have to be quick. They&#8217;ll smooth right out once they hit the oil.</li><br/><li>Set them on some paper towels to dry and cool down.</li><br/><li>Ready to eat. Munch munch munch.</li><br/><li>If you make a bunch at one time you can place the left overs in a brown paper bag and seal them in the microwave. The microwave works well as storage since they won&#8217;t come into contact with much air and will remain crispy longer.</li><br/></ol><br/>You really can&#8217;t eat too many of them since they&#8217;re so hot, but they go great with beer as a small snack. If you leave them in the microwave for a few days they get even hotter so watch out. They&#8217;re also great to crush up and sprinkle on salads or add to sauces and the like for some extra kick.<br/><br/><a title="he best ones to use are long and thin ones like banana peppers not sure if a bell pepper would work since they’re quite thick.
