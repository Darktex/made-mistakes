<p><img src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/353.jpg" alt="Me with my new Palm Pre" width="450" height="360"/><br/><br/>I headed over to the Sprint Store around 8:10am. They told me yesterday they&#8217;d be opening at 10am so I figured I&#8217;d go over early and see if they&#8217;re were any campers. To my surprise the doors were open and ready for business.<br/><br/>Signed in at the front desk and was told it would be about an 2 hour wait since they wanted to do the whole Ready Now routine with new users. Walked around the store, tried out the demo units, and waited for my name to go up the list. The whole experience reminded me of the Apple Genius Bar appointment process.<br/><br/>After 45 minutes or so I finally had my activated <strong>Palm Pre</strong>. The sales associate had me signup for a Palm Profile on the unit, watch the introduction video, and then asked if I had any questions. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this phone since January so I pretty much took the phone and ran after the rep was done with me.<br/><br/>In the car I tried making a call and fired up the web browser just to make sure everything was provisioned correctly. Wow this phone is smaller than I thought it would be. Feels great in the hand, is rock solid, and a joy to use.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ve linked up my Google accounts and noticed some of the fields are marked &#8220;OTHER&#8221; and birthday&#8217;s are missing. Looks like I&#8217;ll have to manually cleanup some things. Shouldn&#8217;t be too bad since I don&#8217;t have many contacts.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m currently waiting for the phone to reboot after the 1.0.2 update. What I&#8217;m really anxious to try is moving over some of my Palm OS apps into Classic and see how that works. <strong>SplashMoney</strong> and <strong>SplashID</strong> don&#8217;t have a webOS alternative right now so I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be dishing out $29.99 to purchase the Classic app.<br/><br/>Photos and possibly some video to follow later&#8230;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-7206462737256107936?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
