<p><strong><a href="http://mademistakes.com/blog/those-city-folk-in-animal-crossing-still-love-the-gossip" target="_blank">Animal Crossing: City Folk</a></strong> has done the unthinkable. It&#8217;s forced me to turn my <em>Nintendo Wii</em> on at least once a day and play in my town. What exactly have I been doing in my town for the past month you ask? Well let me tell you.<br/><br/><strong>Perfect Town Status</strong><br/><br/>Yup. I actually got my <em>golden watering can</em> playing legit. Spent a lot of time replacing my native fruit trees (apple) with foreign fruit and planting trees everywhere I could. Once those town ducks Pelly and Phyllis told me there were too many trees I started planting flowers. You simply can&#8217;t have enough flowers. They counteract having extra trees, garbage, lack of trees, and weeds in each acre. So the more you plant the better chance you have of finding the right mix of trees to acre quota. I had to chop down some trees but that was a hell of a lot easier than planting them and hoping they&#8217;d actually grow.<br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/335.jpg" alt="La mer outside house in frog suit" width="500" height="309"/><br/><br/>If you&#8217;re really bored you could mark off each acre to make your life easier, but I didn&#8217;t bother with that. Once I hit <em>perfect status</em> I just made sure to pick weeds and water my plants for the next two week until Pelly gave me a golden watering can. I then created some new characters to stock-up on golden cans since every resident is allowed to get one will your town is in perfect status.<br/><br/>This little trick worked in <em>AC: Wild World</em> as well, but it was faster to obtain a golden can since you didn&#8217;t have to complete the work detail for Nook before talking to Pelly.<br/><br/><strong>Mortgage Obligations</strong><br/><br/>I&#8217;ve paid off my house in full and no longer owe bells to Tom Nook. Living room expansion → second floor → basement. I&#8217;m not really a fan of having multiple floors and preferred how <em>Wild World</em> gave you rooms built of the main one (had a more traditional house layout feel to it) but it&#8217;s nice being able to decorate the outside of the house with flag pattern of your choice.<br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/339.jpg" alt="Link La mer with the drinking bird" width="500" height="338"/><br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/337.jpg" alt="Link La mer in the backyard" width="500" height="268"/><br/><br/>Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if you had a small plot of land around your house for decorating? Maybe make a garden? Or a backyard? Some of the furniture themes just beg to be used in this way. I mean come on Nintendo, who actually puts a BBQ grill, grass, bird bath, and picnic bench in their house? Well I did—but that&#8217;s besides the point.<br/><br/><strong>Town Niceties</strong><br/><br/>With my town in perfect status and my house paid off the next goal of mine was to donate to the <em>Town Fund</em>. For 200k bells you can get a new bridge, for additional 500k a fountain, and lastly an additional 1,000,000 bells gets you a lighthouse or windmill. <strong>Protip</strong>: deposit your money into the bank until you hit the exact amount required for each town addition. Pelly won&#8217;t tell you that you&#8217;ve hit the required amount until the day after. So you could be wasting money if you just blindly donate and don&#8217;t keep track of the amounts.<br/><br/>And don&#8217;t worry if you choose a windmill and later decide you&#8217;d rather have a lighthouse. You can donate another 1,000,000 bells and change it. Would be nice to have both, but what can you do? I&#8217;ve also read that a lighthouse attracts rare fish and the windmill attracts rare bugs and makes your grass grow back faster. Neither of these are confirmed and from my experience these rumors are bogus. I have yet to see rare fish show up more regularly than usual since I&#8217;ve gotten the lighthouse.<br/><br/><strong>Catalog or Catalogue?</strong><br/><br/>Now that all the big purchases and loans have been paid off, all that&#8217;s left to spend my hard earned bells on is furniture and clothing. Every day I go to Nook&#8217;s and buy furniture to complete my catalog. On <em>5 Point Special</em> days I go nuts and order the most expensive things from my catalog to get extra points. Doing this has gotten me to <strong>platinum member status</strong> fairly quick and I now enjoy <em>20% off at Nook&#8217;s</em>. I&#8217;ve also gained enough points to purchase the <strong>Hero (Link) clothes</strong> from <em>Legend of Zelda</em> and almost have enough for <strong>Samus&#8217; helmet and suit</strong> from <em>Metroid</em>.<br/><br/>And if by some chance you have any animal hats, hoods, or shirts in your town/catalog let me know—I&#8217;d like to buy them. Right now I have a <em>frog hood</em>, <em>bunny hood</em>, <em>cat hood</em>, <em>kappa suit</em>, and <em>bear suit</em>. Not sure how many other animal costumes are out there but I&#8217;d like to fill in the missing pieces. Leave a comment below with your friend code and town info if you&#8217;re interested in helping me out.<br/><br/><strong>Oh Noes My Town Has Been Infected!?!?</strong><br/><br/>From my WiFi travels I&#8217;ve come across some of the <em>Japan only DLC</em> like the <strong>Red Pikmin hat</strong>, a <strong>top</strong>, and a few other rare items. The one side-effect I&#8217;ve encountered from traveling to other towns via <em>Nintendo WFC</em> is being &#8216;infected&#8217; with <a href="http://www.wiinintendo.net/2009/01/20/hacked-dlc-animal-crossing/" target="_blank">Hacked DLC</a>. While I don&#8217;t have any of the hacked items (<strong>ShinyBluePikmin</strong>, <strong>RedLightSabreV1</strong>, and <strong>BlueLightSabreV1</strong>) I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve visited towns that have been altered using the <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Channel" target="_blank">Homebrew Channel</a> and modifying their saves and using cheats. The chances of you being &#8220;infected&#8221; with these hacked items is pretty good if you visit towns, since it&#8217;s probably spread to most people by now. It&#8217;s not a big deal since it won&#8217;t screw up your game or anything malicious like that, but something to be aware of if you want to travel.<br/></p><blockquote>The first side affect is the very, very unlikely to happen. If a HDLC takes up the spot of a regular DLC, or another HDLC, then those new items will not exist to the player.</blockquote><br/>While we&#8217;re on the subject of <em>Nintendo WFC</em> and visiting towns. I&#8217;ve noticed many of the towns I go to participate in <strong>catalog swapping</strong> or <strong>item exchanges</strong>. The general idea is as follows:<br/><blockquote>To complete your catalog, you only need to borrow (as opposed to steal) an item from someone. You do not need to purchase it or even take it back to your own town. Just put the item in your pocket for a moment and that will add its entry to your catalog.</blockquote><br/>What&#8217;s nice is a lot of people just dump items by their town gate&#8217;s for this purpose. I&#8217;ve followed with this trend and have placed some of the rare and interesting stuff I&#8217;ve come across up front so it&#8217;s the first thing you see when entering my town. Some people make free piles as well. I haven&#8217;t gotten around to that yet, but I probably will once I design a nice pattern to use as a ground sign. If you visit my town feel free to swap away or ask me for specific items I might have in my catalog and can send you.<br/><br/><strong>Pattern Making</strong><br/><br/>Tried to make some patterns—which didn&#8217;t turn out all that great. I did create a <em>striped french fishermen looking shirt</em> with a red scarf that looks decent. My animal neighbors must like it because every damn one of them has it on. Talk about playing out a design!<br/><br/>So far I&#8217;ve failed at finding any good online resource for showcasing <strong>Pro Patterns</strong>. <a href="http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/" target="_blank">Animal Crossing Community</a> has a ton of patterns that you can print out and try to recreate in-game. But the palettes don&#8217;t match up directly with <em>AC: City Folk</em> so you have to do some tweaking with the designs.<br/><br/>I really want to create a nice path or grass pattern to replace all the eroded dirt I now have from playing everyday. I remember seeing some nice patterns in <em>AC: Wild World</em> that looked like official sprites from the game. Half of the crummy paths I see online now look horrible and don&#8217;t mesh with the ground at all.<br/><br/><strong>Dinosaurs and Fossils Oh Yeah</strong><br/><br/>My museum collection is coming along rather nicely. Many of the dinosaurs are complete and it&#8217;s looking fantastic. I&#8217;m still trying to find real paintings, but most have been forgeries when purchased from Crazy Redd. Once the season changes I&#8217;ll start working on the fish and bug exhibits. Right now those are pretty bare since there are only so many bass and pond smelts I can stomach.<br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/334.jpg" alt="La mer chilling in the museum" width="500" height="268"/><br/><br/><strong>What Sort of Coffee are You Brewing?</strong><br/><br/>I keep flip flopping between installing the <strong>Homebrew Channel</strong> and not installing it. Part of me wants to just because it&#8217;s so simple and has some nice functionality. But the other half of me worries that Nintendo will do something that ends up bricking my Wii because I installed it. It&#8217;s the same dance hackers have been playing with Sony and the PSP or Apple and the iPhone. They&#8217;ll tempt you with some new feature that needs a firmware update&#8230;and that kills some of the back doors for opening up the device and then the community finds a new hole and releases an update.<br/><br/>I know installing the <strong>Homebrew Channel</strong> is pretty painless and all that. You can remove the <strong>Homebrew Channel</strong> from what I&#8217;ve read, but it still leaves some traces on your Wii that it was installed. Microsoft actively bans modded consoles over <em>Xbox Live</em> so what&#8217;s stopping Nintendo from doing the same&#8230;soft-mods or not? I wouldn&#8217;t care if I didn&#8217;t go online everyday with <em>City Folk</em>. I really don&#8217;t want to buy another Wii just to use the <em>Twilight Princess</em> save hack to install some homebrew apps.<br/><br/>Then there is the issue of using the <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_apps/Gecko_Region_Free" target="_blank">Gecko OS</a> homebrew application to load cheats. Now that I pretty much have everything paid off and my town in good shape, why would I want to cheat? I&#8217;ve gotten most of the golden tools playing legit. It sort of sucks going to towns and seeing fountains, lighthouses, paid off houses, all the expensive furniture from Gracie&#8217;s, all the rare holiday furniture from the future, and knowing that they cheated to get it or had a friend who cheated give it to them. What&#8217;s the point? I&#8217;m already starting to get bored with the game and I don&#8217;t even have everything yet!<br/><br/>I will admit. Turning on the cheat to keep your grass from dying would be nice. Or maybe the <em>moon jump</em> cheat giving you the ability to walk on top of buildings. But getting all the golden stuff or unlimited bells seems sort of pointless to me. Especially since this game is designed to play everyday to earn that stuff.<br/><br/><strong>Wrap-up</strong><br/><br/>So if you actually read all that and still want to visit my town, the details are below. I&#8217;m including my girlfriend&#8217;s friend code as well, since we take turns playing. So add us both and we&#8217;ll return the favor. But please, only add us if you&#8217;re actually going to play online. We&#8217;ve received numerous friend codes from people who have yet to add us back. We&#8217;re running out of spots so serious players only. We try to <strong>open our town weeknights around 8pm EST</strong> for an hour or so. And on the weekends it&#8217;s open more frequently. We don&#8217;t have Wii Speak, but <em>have a USB keyboard</em> for quick chats.<br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/338.jpg" alt="Link La mer in the city with balloon guy" width="500" height="289"/><br/><br/>And just so you know, our residents often say profane, immature, and sexual suggestive things. If that sort of thing offends you or if you play with small children please consider that before adding us. We wouldn&#8217;t want any awkward situations to arise if Camofrog started to hit on you. =-)<br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/336.jpg" alt="La mer froggy in the city" width="500" height="286"/><br/><br/>My Friend Code: <strong>4769-1328-3546</strong><br/>Name: <strong>La mer</strong><br/>Town: <strong>Beetus</strong><br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/340.jpg" alt="Wendy cat with pinwheel" width="500" height="272"/><br/><br/>Wendy&#8217;s Friend Code: <strong>4339-6362-2674</strong><br/>Name: <strong>Wendy</strong><br/>Town: <strong>Beetus</strong><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-4838745842516418518?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
