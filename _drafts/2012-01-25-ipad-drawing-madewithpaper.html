<p>How do you draw or sketch on an iPad with <em>Paper by 53</em>? What iPad stylus is the best for creating art? Why does it burn down there when I pee? Wait a minute&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have an answer for that last one, but I think I can help with the first two.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Obviously you&rsquo;ll need an iPad&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;I use a 3rd generation with the nice retina screen.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper" target="_blank">Paper by FiftyThree</a> for iOS is my sketching app of choice. It&rsquo;s free download, but you&rsquo;ll want to buy additional brushes, pens, and the fantastic color mixer. My favorites are the pencil and watercolor brush.</li>
	<li>A stylus is optional, but highly recommended. I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00821TR7G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mademist-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00821TR7G" target="_blank">LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen</a> and in the past a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042U9AT6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mademist-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042U9AT6" target="_blank">Just Mobile AluPen</a>. If you can&rsquo;t afford a decent stylus right now Amazon has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00575TN42/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00575TN42&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mademist-20" target="_blank">3 pack for $2, with free shipping</a>. These styluses are small and kind of crappy, but do offer more precision than finger painting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every drawing is different and I try to approach them in that way. So what follows are some general steps and techniques I utilize when drawing and painting on an iPad with Paper by 53.</p>

<h2>Block out your composition</h2>

<p>When I begin a new <a href="{{ site.base_url }}/articles/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project.html">PaperFaces portrait</a>, I start by sketching an imperfect square with the pen tool. I use the square as a rough guide for the composition because I like the look of strokes and shapes bleeding outside the border. If you like things neat and tidy, an alternative would be to use the eraser to straighten up the edges as your final step. You could of course forgo the square and fill the entire page&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;whatever works for you.</p>

<h2>Rough sketches</h2>

<p>Usually I pencil in quick gestures and outlines as a guide for painting color. Other times I jump right to the background and splash in layers of watercolor. It really depends on the source material and if the background has enough detail to bother with.</p>

<h2>Watercolor without  water</h2>

<p>I use the watercolor brush in two ways&hellip; well maybe three.</p>

<ol>
	<li>When crisp edges aren’t a concern, I’ll block in color quickly with the watercolor brush. I achieve continuous tones by painting slowly and never removing the stylus (or my finger) from the screen. If I want to create a smooth gradation in color I move the brush progressively faster to fade it out.</li>
	<li>Lightening existing areas is easily achieved with the watercolor brush. Mix enough white into a color and the brush can be used to lighten areas. This technique is perfect for adding highlights or correcting mistakes when an eraser&rsquo;s edges might be too harsh.</li>
	<li>To shade existing areas apply a darker hue, gray, or black. For backgrounds I tend to use a light blue-gray to paint in shadows. I prefer to start light and layer on multiple strokes to add depth and contrast gradually. When working on a subjects&rsquo; face, I&rsquo;ll use a dull brown to add dimension and shape. Applying a coat of gray or brown works wonders on hair as well. Ever wonder how I get the hair in some of the PaperFaces drawings to look more realistic and round? By brushing gray on top of the individual lines of hair I drew with the pencil tool of course!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Filling  shapes with ink</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use the pen tools or marker all that much because I like my illustrations to have painterly feel to them. These tools are perfect for covering a large irregular shaped areas with color&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;like hair. They also come in handy when I need to rework or make adjustments (more precise than the eraser) to something I already drew or painted. Two things to keep in mind when working with the marker tool:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>It has some translucency to it.</strong> If you draw over something, it will most likely show through. Because of this, the marker can make help you shade more precisely than the watercolor brush.</li>
	<li>Black, white, and some <strong>dark colors are opaque</strong>; meaning they will completely cover up anything you draw over.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The multipurpose pencil</h2>

<p>I saved the best for last. When I first started using Paper by 53, I was enamored with the thick and thins of the fountain pen and how try to life the watercolor brush handled. But then I rediscovered an old friend, in a digital world&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Mr. Pencil.</p>

<p>Need to lightly sketch out a face&hellips; pull out the pencil. Need to smoothen out some edges&hellips; pull out the pencil. Need to add shadows and highlights&hellip; pull out the pencil. It has so many uses that by default I spend most of my time with it. My absolute favorite is to use a white pencil on top of a black (or dark background) and sketch in highlights, especially in long hair. It&rsquo;s sick how easy achieving realistic looking hair is when using the pencil.</p>
