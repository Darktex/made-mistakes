<p><img src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/105.jpg" alt="Rescue Dawn (2006)" width="500" height="288"/>With temperatures hitting close to 90ºF here in Buffalo I decided I needed to hit up some place air conditioned. No better hideout than a movie theatre, for sure. Other than the <a title="Bourne Ultimatum Review" href="http://mademistakes.com/blog/bourne-ultimatum-%e2%80%94-a-quick-review/" target="_blank"><em>Bourne Ultimatum</em></a> nothing really pique my interest this week. Decided to check out Dipson’s offering and saw that the new <em>Werner Herzog</em> film <a title="Rescue Dawn Official Website" href="http://rescuedawn.mgm.com/" target="_blank"><em>Rescue Dawn</em></a> was playing on Main Street.<br/><br/>The last Herzog film I saw was <a title="Grizzly Man on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0427312/" target="_blank"><em>Grizzly Man</em></a> and since he did a good job filming nature and all that, figured he couldn’t go wrong with the jungle settings of Vietnam. Add to the mix that <em>Christian Bale</em> was starring in <em>Rescue Dawn</em> and I was sold. I’ve loved him in all his roles; whether he’s playing a serial killer in <a title="American Pyscho on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0144084/" target="_blank"><em>American Psycho</em></a>, a dragon slayer in <a title="Reign of Fire on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0253556/" target="_blank"><em>Reign of Fire</em></a>, a cleric in the future Utopian world of <a title="Equilibrium on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0238380/" target="_blank"><em>Equilibrium</em></a>, a man who can’t sleep in <a title="The Machinist on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0361862/" target="_blank"><em>The Machinist</em></a>, a great magician in <a title="The Prestige on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0482571/" target="_blank"><em>The Prestige</em></a>, or the Dark Knight himself in <a title="Batman Begins on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0450392/" target="_blank"><em>Batman Begins</em></a>.<br/><br/>So back to <em>Rescue Dawn</em>. It’s a film about Dieter Dengler, a US fighter pilot who gets shot down over Laos during the Vietnam War and then taken prisoner. Dieter ends up at a camp with some other American’s who have been there for over two years. Judging by Dieter’s facial hair growth, I’d estimate he was captive for a few months, depending on how accurate the filmmakers were with his appearance.<br/><br/>While captive, Dieter shows the other POW’s how to pick locks and gather left over rice in secret as he devises a plan for escape. The other prisoners are reluctant to leave their only source of food and water at the camp. If they leave they’d have to survive the jungle and probably just die there instead, since that is the <em>real prison</em>. Eventually driven to escape they kill their captors and flee to the jungle where we see Dieter picking leeches off his body and eating snakes for food.<br/><br/>The film is rated PG-13, so the scenes of torture are fairly mild and sparse. I don’t think that was the real goal of this film. In fact I couldn’t really tell you what the goal was. Sure it’s a movie about war, and we see some of the horrors of it. It’s also a movie about survival and the human condition, but everything is so understated as to really make up it’s mind as to what the major theme is.<br/><br/>Inspired by the true events of Dieter Dengler, I give <em>Rescue Dawn</em> a B- for excellent acting and a few moments of on screen brilliance.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-5425934529531355182?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
