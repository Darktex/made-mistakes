What a pleasant surprise it was turning on my <em>Xbox 360</em> around 10pm EST to find that a console update was awaiting me.<br/><br/>The whole process went by pretty fast. Took a few minutes to download and then I was off. I spent about 15 minutes crafting my avatar and posing him just right for my Gamertag picture. The amount of choice is pretty good when compared to <em>Nintendo’s Miis</em>. You can’t position your facial features or change the sizes but you can dress your avatar…something the Miis lack.<br/><br/>The entire interface looks so much better and is way more responsive. I activated my <em>Netflix</em> account and gave streaming movies a go. Worked as advertised and looked on par with a DVD. I’ll have to add some <a href="http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/10/29/hd-netflix-streaming-comes-to-xbox-360-first/" target="_blank">HD content</a> later and see how that looks.<br/><br/>Installed <em>Gears of War 2</em> to my hard-drive to see how that whole process worked. Took about 5 minutes to copy over 6GB’s and then it was ready to launch off my hard-drive. I didn’t notice any load time gains, but man was my machine quiet. I probably won’t install games often since my 20GB hard-drive is tapped out of space, but it’s nice to know I have the option.<br/><br/>Very pleased with the update. <em>Microsoft</em> did a great job with it!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-6696844838303669134?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
