I opt&#8217;ed for the more expensive satin paper which gives the pages a nice texture and thickness to them. Next time I&#8217;m definitely paying extra for a hardcover with slip to better protect it. The only negative I&#8217;ve found with the book is that some of my photographs printed a tad on the dark side. I think it has something to do with how my monitor is calibrated. Images usually look brighter for me, so if I remember to take that into consideration next time I should be fine.<br/><br/><a title="Softcover version" href="http://mademistakes.com/images/309.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="http://mademistakes.com/images/309t.jpg" alt="Six Month Walk Book Cover" width="150" height="150"/></a><a title="Another detail of a printed page" href="http://mademistakes.com/images/312.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="http://mademistakes.com/images/312t.jpg" alt="Six Month Walk Book - Detail 2" width="150" height="150"/></a><a title="Detail of a printed page" href="http://mademistakes.com/images/311.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/311t.jpg" alt="Six Month Walk Book - Detail 1"/></a></p>
