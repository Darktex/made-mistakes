<p>Last week Apple finally unveiled the new generation of iPod&#8217;s. The last iPod I purchased was a 3rd generation model with 40GB of hard drive space and have been waiting for a decent successor. My iTunes Music Library has finally outgrown the 3rd gen so I decided this was the time to get a replacement. I figured an iPod that resembled the iPhone would be just around the corner and pleasantly surprised when the <i>iPod touch</i> was announced.<br/><br/>At 16GB the <i>iPod touch</i> couldn&#8217;t meet my needs, so I decided to go with the new <i>iPod classic</i> 80GB model which should hold me over for the next 2 years. Hopefully by then flash drives sky rocket in capacity and I can get a version of the <i>iPod touch</i> with 100GB+. Until then the classic more than meets what I was looking for andâ€”a music player that can hold all my tunes and have enough juice for a full work day.<br/><br/>The <i>classic</i> has it&#8217;s problems but nothing that is giving me buyer&#8217;s remorse. The following are some reasons I adore my new purchase and then a few areas it needs improving on.<br/><br/><b>The pros:</b></p>

<ul><br/><li>Battery life!!! I played 3 hours of video (with backlight on) and 4 hours of audio and the battery meter barely moved. With a promised 30 hours of audio / 7 hours of video playback I&#8217;m extremely happy with this little guys performance. Sure beats the 20 minutes I&#8217;d get on a full charge with my 3rd gen&#8230;</li>

<br/><li>Nice and thin. About half the size of my old iPod</li>

<br/><li>All metal enclosure. Feels solid and well built.</li>

<br/><li>New interface. Spliting the menu in half and showing album art and photos fade by looks great. There was so much dead space with the 5th generation iPod&#8217;s interface that this is a step in the right direction.</li>

</ul><p><b>The cons:</b></p>

<ul><li>The interface. Sure it has eye candy like <i>cover flow</i> and the new menu design, but it&#8217;s way to sluggish. When you move from music to photos to videos to settings, the menu just chugs along and you have to wait while it pre-fetches artwork. It&#8217;s not a problem once you get into playing some music but half the time I thought I didn&#8217;t press the button because you get no feedback that you actually selected something.</li>

<li>The clock. WTF?!? After 20 seconds of inactivity the <i>Now Playing screen</i> goes away and you get this lame clock displaying the time and battery level. The only way I&#8217;ve been able to get rid of this &#8220;feature&#8221; is by turning the backlight setting to <i>Always On</i>. Must be some energy saving feature Apple thought was necessary. Give me the option to turn this off please.</li>

<li>Scroll wheel sensitivity seems off. Maybe I&#8217;m used to pre-click wheel iPod&#8217;s and it&#8217;s a problem they&#8217;ve all shared, but I have problems rating songs or moving through the menus accurately.</li>

<li>Screen glare. When used in my car during the day I can barely see the screen. Not that big of a deal, but I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t get an <i>iPod touch</i> for this very reason. Would have nearly impossible to navigate through songs since it has no hard buttons and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see the screen.</li>

Great for us with large music collections." href="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/87.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/87t.jpg" alt="iPod classic search"/></a></p>
