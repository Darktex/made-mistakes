<p>I want this phone so bad. It has everything that I&#8217;ve come to love with other Palm devices like the <em>Treo</em> and <em>Centro</em>, but taken to the next level with a new OS and user interface. I&#8217;ve been on the fence about jumping the Palm ship and picking up an <em>Apple iPhone</em>, but something about not having a full QWERTY keyboard, MMS capabilities, removable battery, or the fact that the AT&amp;T plans are crap has held me back.<br/><br/><img src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/231.jpg" alt="Palm Pre (closed and open)" width="455" height="495"/><br/><br/>Well now that the <em>Palm Pre</em> has been announced and I&#8217;ve read <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/13/palm-pre-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know/" target="_blank">every bit of information</a> I can find about the device, I&#8217;m super pumped and can&#8217;t wait for it&#8217;s release. I really don&#8217;t get all forum hate directed at the Pre and Palm. Just take a look at the CES keynote video on <a href="http://palm.com/" target="_blank">Palm&#8217;s website</a> and tell me you aren&#8217;t impressed but what webOS and the Pre can do.<br/></p><blockquote class="quote-body" cite="http://www.newsweek.com/id/178536/">The phone has 8 gigabytes of storage, which is decent but not great; it can run Adobe Flash, and can cut, copy and paste, which iPhone can&#8217;t; it supports multimedia messaging service (MMS) so you can send text messages with photos attached, which iPhone can&#8217;t do; it has a 3 megapixel camera and a flash, which iPhone lacks. There&#8217;s a button that lets you buy music from Amazon&#8217;s download store. Then there&#8217;s the multitasking. Want to talk on the speakerphone while browsing the Web and entering stuff in your calendar? No problem. Palm expects people will keep 15 to 20 applications open at the same time.</blockquote><br/><strong>Reasons why I&#8217;m excited for this phone</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Slick UI, slick hardware design, keyboard!</li> <li>True multitasking. The cards metaphor is great! Sure Apple could add Expos√© to the iPhone eventually, but right now they have nothing close to what Palm is showing.</li> <li>Synergy. Being able to pull all my existing data from the cloud (Google, Facebook, and more) and aggregate it into my contacts, calendar, messaging, and other applications on the Pre.</li> <li>Has everything you&#8217;d expect in a modern mobile phone. WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, blah blah.</li> <li>It&#8217;s going to be available for Sprint. Maybe if the iPhone had a chance of coming out on a network I cared about I&#8217;d be more willing. But something about paying $25-30 more a month for a comparable plan doesn&#8217;t make sense to me. And Sprint really does have the better data network (which is all I really care about anyways).</li></ul><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/13/palm-pre-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know/" target="_blank">Engadget</a> and <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/178536/" target="_blank">Newsweek</a> both have great articles talking about the device and how Palm is set on making a comeback.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-4545675292068111063?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
