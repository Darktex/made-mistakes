Ever notice how terrible inaccurate progress bars are? Always hate how it says &#8220;Less than a minute remaining&#8221; for over 10 minutes at the end. What&#8217;s up with that nonsense?</p>

<p>For the most part all my applications work as they did in 10.5. Not sure if it was a <i>Snow Leopard</i> issue or not, but trying to upload this YouTube video kept crashing Firefox. Eventually gave up and used Safari which worked fine. Maybe I just need to repair permissions and reboot, who knows?</p>

<p>Launching some of my older PPC applications like QuarkXpress 6.5 or ssX worked, but damn are they slow via Rosetta (to be expected). Sort of surprised Quark even opened documents without problem, seeing how it was a buggy mess in Leopard.</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t noticed any speed boosts yet, but that could just be from Spotlight having to reindex my drives and Time Machine backing up 20GB of data.</p>

<p>UI improvements with Expose, the dock and stacks are nice.</p>

<p>Might have reclaimed 6GB of hard drive space, but I&#8217;m not sure. I didn&#8217;t note how much space I had prior to upgrading, and for all I know Onyx reclaimed some of it when I cleared out old log files and caches.</p>

<p>Worth the $29 fee&#8230;at least until I notice a show stopping bug from heavier use this weekend&#8230;</p>
