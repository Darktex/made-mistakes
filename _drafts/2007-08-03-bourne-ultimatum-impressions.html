<p><em>“I remember. I remember everything.”</em> Well not really because, frankly I couldn’t tell you want really happened in the first two Bourne films. <em>Matt Damon</em> plays <em>Jason Bourne</em>; a guy who can kill you with a magazine, find his way out of any situation like MacGyver, well versed in counter intelligence, has amnesia, and no idea why the government is trying to kill him.<br/><br/>That <a title="Franka Potente" href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0004376/" target="_blank">chick</a> from <em>Run Lola Run</em> was in the first two, dies, and <em>Julia Stiles</em> pops in and out of the plot through all three. Everything comes full circle is this third film when Jason finds out his real name and how he ended up in this whole mess. Wasn’t as surprising or as awesome of an explanation that I was expecting, but whatever.<br/><br/>The action was non-stop and a little jarring at times due to the camera work. I think this whole faux-documentary look that the television show <em>24</em> abuses worked against this film. It may have worked for <em>Paul Greengrass’s</em> other film <a title="United 93 (2006) on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0475276/" target="_blank"><em>United 93</em></a>, but I would have liked to have seen Bourne whoop someone’s ass clearly without the jitters. I got a feeling of sickness watching these sequences that I haven’t felt since first seeing the <em>Blair Witch Project</em>, which was a shame.<br/><br/>If you liked the first two you’ll enjoy this one since it wraps up all the loose ends. The <em>Jason Bourne</em> character is pretty cool so I’m sure they’ll keep the franchise going with future movies. Whatever motivation they give him to run in the sequel(s) won’t be as good as this trilogy, but who knows. I’ve been proven wrong before<br/><br/><em>Bourne Ultimatum</em>.
