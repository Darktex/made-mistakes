<p>The other day I finally got around to downloading <em><a href="http://www.blurb.com/" target="_blank">Blurb&#8217;s BookSmart™</a></em><a href="http://www.blurb.com/" target="_blank"> software</a> to layout my book. In the future I really want to create an art book using all my journal drawings, writing, and collages and then get it printed with a hardcover. So to test out the service and see how good the print quality is I created a simple book using photography my girlfriend <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/veganwendy" target="_blank">Wendy</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/michaelknows" target="_blank">myself</a> took over the past six months.<br/><br/>Using the <em>BookSmart™</em> software is super easy. You can link up to online websites (ie: <em>Flickr</em> and <em>Picasa</em>) that might be hosting your photos for easy importing or you can point it to a folder on your hard-drive. Once your photos are imported you can start dropping in photos, giving them captions, adding blocks of copy, and much more. There are a few themes to choose from and numerous templates to get that perfect page layout.<br/><br/>After proofing the pages on screen and making sure everything looked how I wanted, I uploaded my book to <a href="http://www.blurb.com/" target="_blank">Blurb&#8217;s site</a>. From here I was able to order copies and make it available to the public to view and purchase. I think this is great if you want to create books and sell them on the cheap since you don&#8217;t have to pay a fortune for a large print run. Print on demand is great!<br/><br/>You can <a href="http://www.blurb.com/books/446675" target="_blank">preview the first couple of pages</a> from my book and check out a ton of other <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/featured" target="_blank">great books</a> for inspiration.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ll follow up with a future post once I get the book and analyze the quality. With the holidays in full bloom it might take an extra week to print and ship. I sure hope it arrives in time for Christmas&#8230;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-3644209173976437943?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
