I had no interest in seeing the new psychological horror suspense film <a title="IMDb page" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0450385/" target="_blank"><i>1408</i></a> when I first saw the trailer. Thought to myself “nothing special to see here and it’s rated PG-13… blah!” After seeing <i>The Invisible</i> I told myself “no more PG-13 horror movies”. Fast forward to earlier this week when I read a lot of positive reviews of this flick. They all said things like: super creepy, thoughtful, great performance, good film experience, blah blah… ultimately sucking me into the hype.<br/><br/>To be fair, the movie isn’t bad at all. Cusak is Cusak and it’s pretty enjoyable to watch him be his typical sarcastic self. There were a few cheap scares that usually make me jump in these sorts of movies, but not tonight. The story made sense, sorta and everything seemed good, but something was missing. Maybe I expected some crazy twist at the end or something more thoughtful. Who knows.<br/><br/>What I did enjoy was the packed theatre and the various teenagers littered around me. They screamed at the dumbest stuff and I heard some great lines from them. So when you think about it, the experience of seeing this sort of film with a full crowd is really the good part of it all. So I suppose it was worth the $9 ticket. Will definitely be passing this one on the DVD circuit…</p>
