Well you&#8217;d be wrong. Part of the reason I&#8217;ve always hated first person shooters stems from my inability to navigate the terrain and orient myself in the world.<br/><br/>I can remember playing <strong>Halo 3</strong> and trying to get some hidden skulls that required crazy jumps to acquire and just getting frustrated because I kept falling. Could never tell if I was actually standing on the edge of a platform or not. The spatial representation between the character I&#8217;m controlling and objects in the world always seem off to me in these games.<br/><br/>Well I&#8217;m having all of those issues playing <strong>Mirror&#8217;s Edge</strong> on the <em>Xbox 360</em>. The environments look beautiful and when I actually get the controls working in sync with my movements the game can be pretty satisfying. I’ve only completed a few levels so maybe I&#8217;ll adjust eventually and see the true wonder that is flowing around in <strong>Mirror’s Edge</strong>. But right now I don&#8217;t get where all the hype came from when this game dropped a few months ago. Sure the &#8216;idea&#8217; of a first person perspective game based on <em>parkour</em> (free running) instead of shooting is refreshing, but something tells me I’ll bore of it quickly and stop playing after I complete the story. Which seems to be the case with the rest of the hype I&#8217;ve experienced as of late&#8230;<strong>Gears of War 2</strong>&#8230;<strong>Prince of Persia</strong>&#8230;<strong>Dead Space</strong>&#8230;<strong>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</strong>&#8230;<br/><br/>I suppose it’s not a bad thing if the experience is short when it’s is polished, focused, and unique, but games are expensive and I sort of want more for my $59.99 investment. When compared to games like <strong>Rock Band 2</strong> or <strong>Animal Crossing: City Folk</strong> where I’ve played for over 80 hours combined—an 8 hour ride that costs the same seems way out of whack. Good thing there is this service called <a href="http://gamefly.com/" target="_blank">GameFly</a>…</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-5997229425607663406?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
