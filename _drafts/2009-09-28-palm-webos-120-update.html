<p>Well this update has been lackluster. Nothing all that new to write home about.

</p><ul><li>Scrolling seems somewhat improved. If anything it&#8217;s probably due from the fresh reboot&#8230;</li>

<li>Can save images and files directly from the web browser now.</li>

<li>Can copy and paste text and images from web pages now. Cool if you can actually remember what combination of finger gymnastics to pull.</li>

<li><b>Web browser</b> doesn&#8217;t do any of the fun geolocation stuff the iPhone can. They&#8217;re both WebKit based so I&#8217;d assume it&#8217;s possible&#8230;</li>

<li><b>App Catalog</b> is still in beta but it lets you assign a credit card for payments now. Hoping to see an influx of solid apps this week&#8230;</li>

<li><b>Calendar app</b> still blows and is slow. No agenda or year views&#8230;really Palm?</li>

<li><b>Task app</b> is marginally better, but you still can&#8217;t make items repeatable or talk with Google tasks. For pushing this whole idea of synergy I don&#8217;t get why it doesn&#8217;t sync upâ€”when contacts, calendar, email, and messaging do.</li>

<li><b>Camera app</b> saw no improvements from what I can tell. White balance and size options would have been nice. As would direct support for Flickr uploads.</li>

<li>Still no word on video recording or if an official app or update are coming.</li>

<li>No Flash support. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s coming. Not sure I care or will ever have a need for it.</li>

</ul>
