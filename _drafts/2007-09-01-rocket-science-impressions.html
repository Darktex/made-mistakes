<p><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/96.jpg" alt="Rocket Science bus scene" width="500" height="300"/><br/>The mystery that is the <i>Dipson Theatre</i> in the <i>Eastern Hills Mall</i> still eludes me. They could screen pornos on a Friday night and I would still end up being me in a theatre filled with grandparents. I will never understand why the seniors gravitate to these theatres to see films that they have nothing in common with. What possible reason could they have for wanting to see a movie about a stuttering boy who tries out for his high school debate team? Hell Dipson doesn’t even offer a senior citizens discount nor are they any cheaper than the <i>Regal Cinemas</i>. What the heck?<br/><br/>So there you have it. I went to see <a title="Rocket Science Official Movie Site" href="http://www.rocketsciencemovie.com/" target="_blank"><i>Rocket Science</i></a> tonight after waiting a few weeks for it to finally be released here. I’m a sucker for these indie flicks…you know the kind I’m talking about right? Quirky comedies about dorks falling in and out of love, to the tune of a decent soundtrack (in this case Eef Barzelay of <i>Clem Snide</i> and some <i>Violent Femmes</i> tracks), while an omniscient narrator clues us into life’s little nuisances and learned lessons.<br/><br/>I really was hoping for something special with this one. If you saw the trailer, you pretty much got all of this flicks offerings. Sure the story is elaborated on with a few extra laughs, but I thought there would have been something more to it. Perhaps something like <i>The Squid and the Whale</i>, with the alcoholic boy who does some ‘nonsense’ in the library. While not bad I couldn’t really tell you anything amazing about <i>Rocket Science</i>—which should be evident from my shoty movie review.<br/><br/>The actors are great, the story decent, but in the end it failed to really make an impression on me. <i>Thumbsucker</i>, <i>The Chumbscrubber</i>, or any Wes Anderson movie it is not.
