<p>Last Saturday afternoon I went to the <em>Dipson Theatre at the Eastern Hills Mall</em> to see Michael Haneke&rsquo;s 2007 version of <a href="http://wip.warnerbros.com/funnygames/"><em>Funny Games</em></a>. Really the only thing I can say about this film is &ndash; you&rsquo;ll either love it or hate it. Most of the people in the theatre probably hated it since they practically ran out of as soon as the credits rolled and the death metal song started back up. I thought it was amazing!</p>

<p>With most remakes I generally like to see the original so I can compare them and see how bad they fudge it up. The weird thing with Funny Games is the writer/director of the original 1997 German version also directed this newer version specifically for U.S. audiences. What is interesting to note is, Haneke re-shot the film scene for scene. So it ended up looking identical to the original minus the subtitles and with new actors.</p>

<p>After seeing both versions I think the Americanized Funny Games is far superior. The casting is better, the performances more intense, and the tension and dread just come off more believable in the hands of Michael Pitt, Naomi Watts, and Tim Roth.</p>

<p>The 1997 version has a nice DVD extra interview with Michael Haneke that sheds some light on the motivations for the film. I thought he had some interesting ideas on how the viewer becomes an accomplice in violent films by just witnessing the atrocities. He also talked about how he isn&rsquo;t concerned with just telling a story and having it end simply because it should or has to. Instead he&rsquo;d rather develop intelligent villains to make for a better story. A great concept I wish more screenplays and films followed &ndash; since I often find myself cheering on the bad guy.</p>

<p>After seeing Funny Games twice now I really want to go back and watch some of his other films. Years ago I saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0254686/"><em>The Piano Teacher</em></a> and don&rsquo;t really remember much about it, other than it being awkward and weird. He also wrote and directed <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0387898/"><em>Cach√©</em></a>, which is a more conventional suspense/thriller about a couple who receive strange packages from a voyeur.</p>

<p>Having a Netflix subscription sure makes seeking out these films a hell of a lot easier.</p>
