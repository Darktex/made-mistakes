<p>Mmmm, good popcorn today at the movies. It’s obviously why <i>Dipson Theatres</i> was voted best popcorn in Western New York. Apart from the popcorn the real reason I was at Dipson was to see the new Greg Kinnear and Steve Carrell comedy, <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>.</p>

<p>Saw the previews for this a few months ago and have been anxiously waiting for its premiere in Buffalo. All the characters were great and I really got this family vacation that gets worse and worse vibe from it. Although it wasn’t about a family vacation and didn’t resemble any of <i>those</i> Chevy Chase films, it was pretty funny.<br/><br/>Nearly every matinee I’ve been to at Dipson seems to be filled with only senior citizens. Hearing them laugh at the use of naughty words like “fuck” cracks me up everytime. But yeah, the film is about a family’s trip to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant so the youngest daughter—Olive can compete. Brother Dwayne… who takes a vow of silence and Uncle Frank… who recently attempted suicide, reluctantly accompany divorce bound Mommy and Daddy in a old VW bus. Oh and then there is Grandpa who loves to snort the white stuff and has a penchant for porno mags.<br/><br/>Plenty of laughs, good acting, and an awesome soundtrack make for a really good film. B+ in my book.</p>
