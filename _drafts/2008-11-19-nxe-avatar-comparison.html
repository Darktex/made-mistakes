<p><img src="http://mademistakes.com/images/219.jpg" alt="Rock Band avatar versus NXE avatar" width="395" height="301"/><br/><br/>With the release of the <em>New Xbox Experience</em>, I spent some time trying to craft an avatar that resembled me. I don’t think I pulled it off to the same degree of perfection as I did with my <em>Mii</em> and <em>Rock Band</em> characters. It’s in the ballpark but not quite there yet. Maybe it has something to do with the beard selection…<br/></p><h4>What I Like</h4><ul><li>Creating gamerpics with your avatar. While it’s not quite the same as using my own upload graphics or photos, it’s better than nothing.</li> <li>Overall quality and style of the avatars. Not too cartoony and not overly realistic.</li> <li>Being able to save your favorite outfits making it easier to change between them.</li></ul><h4>What I Don’t Like</h4><ul><li>Facial hair looks flat and painted on. Why not add some depth to it like in Rock Band? It would look OK if I had a stubble but I don’t.</li> <li>Need more clothing options. <em>Microsoft</em> announced that they’ll be <a href="http://www.videogaming247.com/2008/11/19/nxe-avatar-theme-packs-confirmed-for-next-six-months/" target="_blank">releasing more options</a> in the coming weeks. Cool. But what I’d like to see is the ability to customize the colors of each article of clothing and accessory. Again just copy what <em>Rock Band</em> did with their character creator.</li></ul><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7408698072416262617-6989166544754409746?l=mademistakesexport.blogspot.com"/></div>
