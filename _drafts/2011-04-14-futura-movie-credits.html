<p>After <a href="http://vimeo.com/22389416">watching a trailer</a> for the new film <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, I was quickly reminded of <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> by Stanley Kubrick. Not only does it look to share similar themes, but also the use of the typeface Futura in its opening credits.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t recall how often Kubrick used Futura in his titles, but I know for sure that Wes Anderson almost exclusively uses the typeface. Often creeping out from the titles and into the set design, signage, and props.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com">greatest television series</a> of all time also made use of Futura. On a simple black background, the word LOST set in Futura would rotate towards the screen leading into the first commercial break. My memory is a little hazy, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure all the Dharma Initiative products were set with Futura as well.</p>

<p>Can you recall any other recent films or television series using this excellent geometric typeface from the late 1920&rsquo;s?</p>
