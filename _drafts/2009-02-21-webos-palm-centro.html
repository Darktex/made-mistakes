<p>Just saw that <i>TealPoint Software</i> released a WebOS skin (launcher) for Palm devices like the <i>Centro</i> and <i>Treos</i> called <a href="http://www.tealpoint.com/softos.htm" target="_blank">TealOS</a>. They have a 30 day trial version you can <a href="http://www.tealpoint.com/softos.htm" target="_blank">download</a> and give before purchasing a full version for $14.95.<br/><br/>Took a few seconds after first running the TealOS launcher for it to create thumbnail and icon images of all my applications, but after that I was presented with a home screen that looks like the <i>webOS</i> UI that&#8217;s going to debut on the Palm Pre later this year. You can navigate through open applications with the new card view—remove them with a flick of your finger, change their order, etc. It&#8217;s a little sluggish when switching between cards and they don&#8217;t have live previews, but they do accurately represent each of the applications and have some nice transitions and transparency to them.<br/><br/>At the bottom of the home screen you&#8217;ll see a <i>Quick Launcher</i> bar that can be customized. Just like Palm Pre, sliding your finger from the bottom of the screen upwards opens the <i>Wave Laucher</i>, which lets you open applications when not on the home screen. The <i>Wave Launcher</i> can also be customized with whatever application icons you see fit.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ve never been one to purchase launchers for my Palm devices, but this one looks  polished enough if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing. If you want to give your aging smartphone an update—I suggest downloading the trial version of <a href="http://www.tealpoint.com/softos.htm" target="_blank">TealOS</a> to hold you over until the Palm Pre releases.<br/><br/>Quick video demonstration of the TealOS launcher after the jump.<br/><a href="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/341.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/341t.jpg" alt="TealOS home" width="150" height="150"/></a><a title="Looks pretty good and not too sluggish." href="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/342.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/342t.jpg" alt="TealOS cards"/></a><br/><br/><object height="350" width="425" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/K0BvdfybMME&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">
