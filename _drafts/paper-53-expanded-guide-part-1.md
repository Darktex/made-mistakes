Paper by 53 and me were BFFs from the start. Spread across my journals you'd find around 600 pages with creation times ranging from 30 minutes to 4 hours. A conservative estimate has me logged at around 500 hours of drawing and painting in this iOS app --- which is kind of crazy when I think about it. I'm not sure if that qualifies me as a good teacher or what, but I'm going to try and expand on some tips and techniques I've previously written about in a 3 part series.

<< insert Paper journals screenshot >>

This first part is predominantly about the benefits of a stylus, how to use all of the Paper by 53 tools, and basic gestures you'll want to master. Parts 2 and 3 will dig deeper into techniques I use to capture realism in my drawings, advanced features like copying pages, organizing color, making Paper by 53 videos, and getting featured in the *Made With Paper* gallery.

## Does a Stylus Work Well with Paper by 53 

The first benefit is the most obvious --- it feels more natural to draw with a tool that resembles a pencil or pen than the tip of your index finger. I don't know about you, but the last time I used my fingers to make "art" I was in elementary school finger painting with [tempera](http://www.crayola.com/things-to-do/how-to-landing/tempera-paint.aspx). For most, drawing on an iPad with a capacitive stylus will immediately feel familiar to their analog counterparts --- paper and pencil. 

This feel of familiarity has the advantage of offering more control when wielding it. If you decide to go with a capacitive stylus be aware that it won't match the precision of a traditional pen or pencil. This is because the tips are fat and rubbery to mimic you're finger in order to trigger a touch event with the iPad's sensors. 

**Pro-tip:** For those craving precision I'd suggest trying one of the many [**Adonit Jot**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00931K1QK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00931K1QK&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20) styli. The tips on these bad boys have clear plastic tips that can pivot and tilt allowing you to see exactly where you are on the iPad's screen.
{: .notice}

Going one step further are styli built with pressure sensitivity in the tip that can alter the characteristics of a mark depending on how hard you press it. Paper by 53 supports Ten One Design's **Pogo Connect Smart Pen** out of the box, and has quickly become my go to stylus when creating on iPad. To learn more about how it became a favorite, check out my [screenshot filled review]({{ site.url }}/articles/pogo-connect-smart-pen.html "My Pogo Connect Smart Pen Review") here.

## The Tools and How they Behave

Starting with order of appearance you have the following tools at your disposal: [*eraser*](#eraser), [*fountain pen*](#fountain-pen) (draw), [*pencil*](#pencil) (sketch), [*marker*](#marker) (outline), [*ink pen*](#ink-pen) (write), [*watercolor brush*](#watercolor-brush) (color), and [*color mixer*](#color-mixer). The fountain pen and eraser are included with the free app --- the rest can be downloaded via in-app purchase as a set or individually.
When describing these tools I will be using the following descriptors:

* **Speed:** How does the speed of drawing affect a line's weight.
* **Character:** Are marks opaque[^opaque] or translucent and how many layers are needed to make a pure color[^pure-color].
* **Sensitivity:** How are marks and line quality affected by the amount of pressure applied when using a Pogo Connect Smart Pen or [Jot Touch 4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AO1L1RG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00AO1L1RG&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20).

### Eraser {#eraser}

The eraser does what its name implies --- it erases. It is not the most precise tool with such a fat tip, which is why I prefer to rewind mistakes ([more on that later](#rewind)) instead.

For handling cleanup duty, the eraser is very effective at defining edges and making them straight. By simply running it along an edge you can remove jaggies left by a pencil or watercolor stroke.

<< insert erased edge screenshot >>

* **Speed:** Slow = thin. Fast = thick.
* **Character:** Completely opaque. One stroke erases down to the egg shell white colored background.
* **Sensitivity:** Soft = thin. Hard = thick.

### Fountain pen (Draw) {#fountain-pen}

Along with the eraser, the fountain pen is included for free when you download Paper by FiftyThree from the App Store. This was the tool I originally used the most when experimenting with Paper a year ago. It's hard not to fall in love with the flowing lines it makes when sliding your fingertips across the iPad's glass screen.

My drawing style has involved over the year from crisp line work to soft blended edges and tones. Because of this shift the fountain pen sees less use from me and has been demoted to janitorial status like the eraser. Perfect for getting into tight places it also works well when coloring large blocks of color.

<< insert background fill cover-up screenshot >>

**Pro-tip 1:** The eraser removes everything --- including a background filled with color. A fountain pen filled with color that matches the background can be used instead of the eraser to correct mistakes.
{: .notice}

* **Speed:** Slow = thin. Fast = thick.
* **Character:** Almost fully opaque. Depending on the color it can take 2--3 layers to create a purely opaque color.
* **Sensitivity:** Soft = thin. Hard = thick.

### Pencil (Sketch) {#pencil}

Versatile and perfect in almost any situation --- this is the one tool you should invest time in learning. The marks created by the pencil have a nice texture to them which makes it perfect for shading and blending colors together gradually. It also works great for lightly sketching to nail your composition before inking and painting.

<< insert pencil sketch screenshot >>

Shading power is amplified immensely when used with a fancy Bluetooth stylus with pressure sensitivity. If you've used a pencil in real life to draw you already know how to use this digital incarnation --- making it one of the most precise and forgivable tools in Paper's toolbox. 

* **Speed:** Slow = dark. Fast = light.
* **Character:** Translucent --- takes many layers to create a purely opaque color.
* **Sensitivity:** Soft = light. Hard = dark.

### Marker (Outline) {#marker}

Unlike the fountain pen, the marker makes transparent marks you can see through. To make sense of the marker I like to think of it behaving like one of those yellow highlighters. If you drew yellow over black it wouldn't show up, the same is true in Paper.

<< insert layers of marker highlighter screenshot >>

The exception to this rule is when the marker is filled with white. In this case it would act almost identically to the eraser but instead of leaving an off white mark in its wake, you get an almost fully opaque white. 

<< insert eraser vs. marker lines screenshot >>

When crisp shadows and values are desired in your illustrations, the marker tool is A+++. I tend to work more photo-realistic and like my gradations on the softer side, but if you want that comic book look the marker might be your new BFF.

<< insert comic style shading with marker screenshot >>

* **Speed:** Slow = thick. Fast = thin.
* **Character**: Transparent, with the exception of white and black.
* **Sensitivity**: Soft = thin. Hard = thick.

### Ink pen (Write) {#ink-pen}

Like the name implies the ink pen behaves most closely to a roller-ball pen. If you look closely at the lines it creates you'll notice heavier spots where a stop or start occurred. Smooth lines without these heavier points can be achieved by moving quick throughout the stroke.

<< insert start/end points ink pen screenshot >>

If you found the fountain pen's thick/thins undesirable or hard to control the ink pen might be a better choice. The ink pen has less variation in line-width making it a perfect choice for writing or doing detail work. 

Before I began using a Pogo Connect Smart Pen exclusively, I did all my lettering and writing with the fountain pen. I found the pressure sensitivity of that stylus difficult to control when crafting letter forms, so I switched to the ink pen[^pen-lettering] instead. 

* **Speed:** The difference is barely noticeable. Moving slower will make a slightly thicker line.
* **Character:** Opaque.
* **Sensitivity:** The difference is barely noticeable. Pressing harder will make a slightly thicker line.

### Watercolor brush (Color) {#watercolor-brush}

Like the pencil, the watercolor brush is another tool you really should spend some time experimenting with to learn all its nuances. This tool sets Paper apart from other apps by replicating the natural feel of pushing and pulling paint and water across a canvas. Without it I wouldn't be able to shade, paint skies, or render hair realistically at all.

**Pro-tip:** While there is no obvious way to change the size of your brush in Paper by 53, you can make thinner lines when used with a pressure sensitive stylus like the Pogo Connect Smart Pen. Pressing lighter will get you a line about a 1/4th as thick as the default.
{: .notice}

It helps to think of you stylus tip as a brush loaded with watered down paint. Because the paint has been thinned it won't be as intense or saturated as the color from one of the pens. Instead you need to build up color with multiple layers.

<< insert choppy brush vs consistent brush screenshot >>

This "thinned out" behavior also factors into how even of a coat you can apply. *Moving the brush faster* doesn't let the paint fully cover a spot and will make it appear choppy. While *moving slowly* allows the paint to flow evenly off the brush and build into a dark even value. Mastering the speed at which you apply color is essential to creating even tones for shading.

It may be helpful to create a few color scales with the primary colors, gray, and black to practice. Below are a couple scales I created for myself after FiftyThree updated Paper to include the the Color Mixer tool.

<< insert color scales screenshot >>

**Pro-tip:** When loaded with white the watercolor brush can become a way to lighten areas you've previously painted or drawn. Just keep in mind that white paint doesn't behave like other colors and can be difficult to master. If you paint too slowly it will remove most of the color and leave you with bright white spots.
{: .notice}

### Color Mixer {#color-mixer}

Before the Color Mixer existed, you had to get creative if you wanted a color other than the nine Paper shipped with. While possible to mix this colors into each other on canvas using the watercolor brush or marker --- it wasn't the most desirable solution. Some colors worked great with this method while others just turned to mud when applying too many layers.

<< insert primary color mixes with watercolor screenshot >>

Color theory is a tricky dick --- thankfully FiftyThree did something great with their Color Mixer. Mixing in colors from any of the new palettes will almost always give you something that looks great.

For those who need more control or want a traditional color picker --- one can be accessed by dragging a color swatch onto the mixing wheel, then tapping on it. From here you can adjust a color's hue, saturation, and brightness.

<< insert color picker screenshot >>

For a good shadow color I generally edit the base color I'm shading and crank the saturation way down and the brightness way up.

**Pro-tip:** If you go too far in any direction you will approach pure white, which will make the watercolor brush or marker opaque. Each color has a different "point of no return," that can be found by experimenting with the sliders.
{: .notice}

**Pro-tip:** Sometimes approaching the "point of no return" is a good thing --- especially when you need a color for lightening. Instead of using pure white, I like to start with the base color I'm working with and crank the brightness way up to get less dramatic tints when erasing.
{: .notice}

## Perfect these gestures

If you only learn two gestures for Paper, make them Rewind and Zoom.

### Rewind {#rewind}

I'm going to let you all in on a little secret. The first couple of months I used Paper by 53, I absolutely hated the Rewind feature. It pissed me off so much that I couldn't trigger it, that I gave up and used the eraser instead. I would have killed for a button with multiple undo's back then...

<< insert rewind screenshot >>

I eventually came to my senses and gave it another go by forcing myself to use Rewind exclusively to undo mistakes. Didn't take long but I got the hang of it and was time traveling back through my boo boo's with ease. It's is entirely possible that FiftyThree tweaked Rewind behind the scenes to make it easier to use, but I like to think it was my perseverance that made the difference.

Just stick with it if you're having trouble, I promise it will eventually come naturally. And if it doesn't, you can always purchase the Pogo Connect or Jot Touch 4 and map the buttons on them to undo. Even with a dedicated undo button I still find myself rewinding back through my mistakes because it's much faster.

### Zoom

The single most requested feature by fans and haters of Paper... Zoom. I had drawn a couple hundred portraits just fine without zoom, but boy was I happy when FiftyThree finally added the feature. That said I did cheat a bit by using an accessibility feature in iOS[^ios-zoom] that lets you magnify the screen by tapping with 3 fingers. Not a true zoom, but it does have its place when you need to magnify an area --- the tools don't scale so it isn't that useful.

There isn't much else to Zoom, I'm merely mentioning it to increase awareness around it. Unlike other drawing and painting apps with zoom, the entire canvas doesn't scale. Instead you control the area you want magnified by you opening a circular <s>portal</s> loupe that can be moved around or dismissed by tapping outside of it.

<< insert Zoom screenshot >>

**Pro-tip:** To move the loupe drag it around at the edge, right on the black frame. It can be picky sometimes, but nowhere near as temperamental or tricky as Rewind.

## And We're Out

Well there you have it. I hope this has served as a good introduction to Paper by 53, how to use the  tools, the gestures, and a taste of what is possible with the app. Part 2 of this series will focus on drawing techniques and how to use the tools to create realistic skies, clouds, skin, hair, landscapes, and lighting effects. While Part 3 will dip into some advanced features like organizing journal pages and color, recording screen capture videos, and how I got my creations featured in the *Made With Paper* gallery. 

Be sure to check back soon, add the [Made Mistakes feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MadeMistakes) to your RSS reader of choice[^rss-reader] or [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mmistakes) to know when they drop. And if you're struggling with something or need further explaining, don't hesitate to leave a comment below. Sometimes things make more sense in my head than when I type them out...

[^opaque]: Not transparent or translucent; impenetrable to light; notallowing light to pass through.

[^pure-color]: I define pure as matching the color selected in the mixer. Many of the tools have a hint of translucency to them and need 2-3 layers to match exactly.

[^pen-lettering]: I suppose I could break the creative flow and switch to a traditional capacitive stylus for just lettering if I wanted to continue using the fountain pen. Nah...

[^ios-zoom]: The iPad has a system wide zoom feature that allows you to enlarge the screen by 3 finger tapping it. To activate, go to **Settings** > **General**. Tap on **Accessibility** and then turn on **Zoom**.

[^rss-reader]: I like to sync all my RSS feeds with [Feedly](http://feedly.com) in a desktop browser along with their mobile apps. [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com) is also quite nice if you prefer the digital magazine approach.
