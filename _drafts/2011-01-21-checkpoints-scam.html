<p>Why do I get the funny feeling that everyone who has amassed enough points for some Amazon gift cards get&#8217;s the perma-ban from CheckPoints? Probably not a good idea to scan products every day, huh? It&#8217;s not like someone could potentially be working in a grocery store and have access to all the items or anything&#8230; right?</p>
