<p>Looks like I might actually get an <strong>iPhone 4</strong> on launch day. Took AT&amp;T all day to process the order I made at 6:50am EST (6/15/2010), but everything is looking good. Guessing I had no problems getting through because I was a new customer and didn&#8217;t have to deal with the servers looking up my account info for upgrade eligibility.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m just worried that my existing number is going to be ported over today from Sprint and I&#8217;ll be without service on my <strong>Palm Pr</strong>e. From the looks of it AT&amp;T confirmed my number port for 12:30pm today (6/16/2010). Sure hope it doesn&#8217;t take effect until I activate via iTunes next week.</p>

<p>Now the waiting game begins&#8230;</p>
