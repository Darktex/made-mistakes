<p>About a month ago my <em><strong><em>Xbox 360</em></strong></em> finally died and began flashing the dreaded “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_ring_of_death" target="_blank"><em>Red Ring of Death</em></a>“ at startup. For some time now my <em>Xbox 360</em> exhibited signs of dying—as it would lock up frequently and give me disc read errors on brand new games. Seeing how pretty much everyone I know has had problems with their <em>Xbox 360’s</em>, I was really surprised mine lasted this long.<br/><br/>First thing I did after getting the <em>RRoD</em> was to check <em>Microsoft’s</em> website to confirm that my <em>Xbox 360</em> was indeed dead. After determining that it was time to send it back to <em>Microsoft</em>, I hit up their support pages to start the process.<br/><br/>I’ll give it to <em>Microsoft</em> on this one. Registering my <em>Xbox 360</em> and requesting a repair order was extremely easy and painless. Took me a few seconds to fill out the necessary online forms and check my warranty info (good thing they extended the date). Best part was I never had to call <em>Microsoft</em> and try to explain my problem to some horrible customer service representative.<br/><br/>What followed next was the hard part…waiting patiently for <em>Microsoft</em> to mail me a box to pack my <em>Xbox 360</em> into and ship it back to them. After 3 days it arrived and included clear instructions (with pictures) describing how to safely pack it up. Took the box to local <em>UPS Store</em> and had them ship it out, all on <em>Microsoft’s</em> dime.<br/><br/>About two weeks later I received a phone call from <em>UPS</em> notifying me of the estimated deliver date of my <em>Xbox 360</em> and that someone needed to be present and sign for it. I knew the date prior to the phone call since I made a routine of checking my <em>Xbox 360’s</em> repair status from <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank">xbox.com</a> everyday. But still, it was nice to know that they were making an effort to keep me well informed.<br/><br/>I’m not sure if they swapped out the bad hardware or just gave me a refurbished console. I guess I should have written down my console’s serial number prior to shipping, so I could have compared the two. Either way, I got my <em>Xbox 360</em> back and it’s had zero problems since. The disc read errors I had previously are gone, which leads me to believe they gave me a different console. Unless of course they replaced the DVD drive as well, which I doubt they did. It even seems to run quieter which is a nice treat.<br/><br/>No complaints from me on this whole process. I just hope I don’t have to go through it again if this unit dies…<br/><br/><a title="Unboxing my repaired Xbox 360." rel="lightbox-rrod" href="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/169.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="http://mademistakes.com/assets/images/169t.jpg" alt="My Xbox 360 in it's coffin" width="150" height="150"/></a> <a title="Everything looks good.
