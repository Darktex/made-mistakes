<article class="content">
  <p>Just finished watching a DVD which I never got to see at Market Arcade when it played in Buffalo this past winter. Well that was depressing. <a title="The Bridge on IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0799954/" target="_blank"><strong>The Bridge</strong></a> is a documentary that was shot over the span of a year, capturing people committing suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. You learn about their stories of lament as told by friends and family. It&rsquo;s quite sad hearing the events that caused these people to seek out the bridge as a means to an end, but actually seeing them jump off is something else completely.</p>
  <p>I had no idea they&rsquo;d actually show real footage of these people jumping, and was in shock when it happened. The first scene they showed had me questioning if it really happened and if I was really seeing that man jump off because it was so surreal. Watching them pace around the edge, contemplating death, and seeing tourists and numerous people ignoring them as they pass by really makes you sick. It immediately puts you in that situation and you start to ask yourself questions like: &ldquo;would I notice them?&rdquo;, &ldquo;would I reach out to them and try to talk them back?&rdquo; or &ldquo;would I be afraid of embarrassing them by asking if they needed help?&rdquo;</p>
