<p>Saturday afternoon I went to my mother&rsquo;s house to pick up some old baseball cards and a few board games they found in the attic. After filling my lungs with ten year old attic dust I sat in the back room by the fire and rested. My mom had saved the Gusto from Friday&rsquo;s <i>Buffalo News</i> and wanted to show me an <a href="http://buffalonews.com/editorial/20070119/1056675.asp/">article about Sal&rsquo;s</a>.</p>

<p>Sal&rsquo;s is this small bar in Depew, NY situated between a few houses in the middle of suburbia. I can remember the first time I went there and thinking it was the strangest place for a bar. I thought I was walking into someone&rsquo;s house and would have never noticed the place since it&rsquo;s on some side street in what looks like every other average Buffalo suburb.</p>

<p>I was promised the best wings in Buffalo. I won&rsquo;t go as far as dethroning that title from <em>Duff&rsquo;s Famous Wings</em> on Sheridan Drive, but their wings are a lot more crispy and come smaller (which I like), but have more of a barbecue sauce flavor mixed in. I&rsquo;ve always gotten medium hot because my brother assured me that hot would melt my face. Well last time we went I thought &ldquo;Shit! I can do Duff&rsquo;s hot&hellip; <em>(where medium is hot and hot is very, very hot!)</em> I can surely do Sal&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo; WRONG! I ate the first five no problem and by number six I was in pain. Not even the pitcher of Blue could cool me down.</p>

<blockquote><p>The wings were the draw for our party of four, eager to sample the much-heralded breading and medium hot and barbecue flavors. It was a one-woman operation as Debbie poured drafts at the well-stocked bar and cooked food orders from Sal&rsquo;s modest menu (the Cajun fries aren&rsquo;t listed, but ask for them &ndash; they&rsquo;re a necessary complement to any wing order). A quick look in Sal&rsquo;s postage-stamp sized but immaculate kitchen suggests anything but the basics would be too ambitious.</p></blockquote>

<p>Woah! I never knew they had cajun fries! I canâ€™t wait to go and try those out. Also when the hell did Toronto get a Duff&rsquo;s? I found <a href="http://www.duffsfamouswings.ca/">this website</a> and it&rsquo;s the same logo and design treatment on the Duff&rsquo;s here in Buffalo so it must be the same. Weird? Man now I want wings really bad.</p>
