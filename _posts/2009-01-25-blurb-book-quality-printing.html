<p>Designing a book with Blurb was painless and having it printed was equaly enjoyable. I'm really happy with how my first photography book turned out.</p>
<p>I sprung for the more expensive satin paper to give the pages a nice texture and thickness to them. Next time I&rsquo;m definitely paying extra for a hardcover with slip so pages are better protected. The only negative I&rsquo;ve found with the printing is that some of my photographs printed a tad on the dark side. I didn't bother calibrating my monitor or using any of Blurb's supplied <a href="http://www.blurb.com/downloads/Blurb_ICC_Profile.icc">ICC color profiles</a>, so that was probably the issue. </p>
<p>They offer some guidance on <a href="http://www.blurb.com/color-management" target="_blank">color management</a>, that I'll look at more closely next time. I'm also planning on designing my next book using Adobe InDesign and <a href="http://www.blurb.com/indesign-plugin" target="_blank">Blurb's Plug-in</a> instead of their <a href="http://www.blurb.com/booksmart" target="_blank">BookSmart&reg;</a> application&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;just so I have total control over each page.</p>
