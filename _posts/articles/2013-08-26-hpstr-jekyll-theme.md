They say three times the charm, so here is another free Jekyll blog theme for you. I've learned a ton since open sourcing my first two themes [on Github](http://github.com/mmistakes), and wanted to try a few new things this time around. If you've used my previous themes most of this should be familiar territory...

## What HPSTR brings to the table:

* Responsive templates for post, page, and post index `_layouts`. Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* Gracefully degrads in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.  
* Modern and minimal design.
* Sweet animated menu.
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Comments powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com) if you choose to enable.
* Social Sharing links for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ if you choose to enable.
* Simple and clear permalink structure[^1].
* [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support for a better social sharing experience.
* Simple [custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting]({{ site.url }}/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy
* Fully compatible with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) build script for easy theme development
