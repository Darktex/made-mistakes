<article class="content cleafix">
    <p>A few weekends ago I decided to cover one of the walls in the office with a large poster. Iâ€™ve toyed around with black and white rasterbated images before, but I really wanted to see how well a full color one would look. My office walls are a lime green color and I figured something with dark greens would contrast nicely. Choosing a forest scene with a huge owl seemed right up my alley so I got to work on it&rsquo;s creation.</p>
    <p>Took some quick measurements of the wall&rsquo;s dimensions and uploaded the image to the <a href="http://arje.net/rasterbator" target="_blank">Rasterbator</a>. Got things cropped how I liked and outputted the 120 page PDF file. The next 3 hours I spent trimming the white borders off of each page since my printer doesn&rsquo;t print to the edge. I think next time I do one of these I&rsquo;m going to leave the borders&hellip; cutting these pages consistently was pretty hard. I tried using a trimmer with a rotary blade but the pages slide some regardless of the clamp thing. Oh well.</p>
    <p>Anyways. After cutting out all the pages I setup my JVC mini-DV camcorder and recorded myself taping each page to the wall. Figured this would be a fun excuse to use the camcorder since I rarely break the thing out after buying it 4 years ago. Took the 2 hours of footage and imported it into iMovie and made a quick time lapse video by speeding it up 4x. I think it came out good and laugh every time I see my stupid cats walking around watching me in confusion.</p>
