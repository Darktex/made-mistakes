<article class="content-wide clearfix">
    <p>So we went and saw <strong>Paranormal Activity</strong> last night. If you haven&rsquo;t heard it&rsquo;s basically the <strong>Blair Witch Project</strong> shot in a haunted house. I couldn&rsquo;t have planned it better because earlier in the day my <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/c427/" target="_blank">Eviltron from Think Geek</a> showed up which gave me time to plant it in our bedroom.</p>
    <p>The fact that we just saw a movie about strange noises and ghosts, made hiding the Eviltron perfect for some effective scares. At first I acted startled at the scratching noises and played it up as if there was a mouse or rodent in our attic. But when the small child laughed and it whispered &ldquo;hey, can you hear me?&rdquo; Wendy freaked out and I had to end the prank. Pretty sure she was ready to runaway and go to her parents&rsquo; house for the night.</p>
    <p>Trick or treat!!!</p>
