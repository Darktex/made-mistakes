description: "The Eviltron rules. The sounds may not sound all that impressive on they're own. But if you have this hidden and they start going off at night, your victim will freak out pretty quick. Trust me!"

<p>So we went and saw <em>Paranormal Activity</em> last night. If you haven&rsquo;t heard it&rsquo;s basically the <em>Blair Witch Project</em> shot in a house. I couldn&rsquo;t have planned it better because earlier in the day my <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/c427/" target="_blank"><em>Eviltron</em></a> package showed up which gave me time to plant it in our bedroom to cash in on the scares later.</p>
<p>The fact that we just saw a movie about strange noises and ghosts, was going to make having the <em>Eviltron</em> super effective. At first I acted startled at the scratching noises and played it up as if there was a mouse or rodent in our attic. But when the small child laughed and it whispered &ldquo;hey, can you hear me?&rdquo; Wendy freaked out and I had to end the prank. Pretty sure she was ready to runaway and go to her parents&rsquo; house for the night.</p>
<p>Trick or treat!!!</p>
