	<p>Glad to see improvements in the May 2011 <em>Urban Outfitters</em> catalog. Especially since I took a few <a href="/typography-urban-outfitters.html">issues with the typography</a> and other design choices last month.</p>
	<p>I was shocked to see product copy that was almost legible and set in a serif typeface instead of a sans (<a href="http://www.p22.com/products/underground.html"><em>P22 Underground</em></a>?). Plus they even made a half effort to number blocks of text with corresponding photographs on the page (see below for example). Although it would have been nice if they actually captioned the photographs so I don't have to think as much&hellip;</p>

		<figcaption>The serif typeface used here is quite beautifulâ€”especially the ampersand glyph and italic set.</figcaption>

	<h2>It's a shame to see such perfectly crafted photography&hellip;</h2>
	<p>Sullied by page spreads that are obviously more interested in making beautiful pictures than helping customers make informed buying decisions.</p>

		<figcaption>It's really hard to tell what this catalog is trying to sell, beautiful photographs or clothing and accessories?</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>I've tired trying to discover any sort of detail on the clothing and product sold in this catalog. I mean how could I? You basically need a magnifying glass and more patience I'm willing to waste trying to sort out what price and item number goes with each photograph.</p>
