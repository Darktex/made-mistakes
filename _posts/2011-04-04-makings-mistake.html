        <p>As a designer we&rsquo;ve all been there. When was the last time you got bored with a design and decided to just scrap it and start from scratch? Yeah, that's what I thought.</p>   
        <p>For the last decade I&rsquo;ve been fighting &ldquo;the loop&rdquo;, squeezing my words in and out of every major web content management system, trying to tame DIV-itus, and determining what voice and creative outlets to live in. Depending on which half of my brain you asked, you&rsquo;d probably get a different answer about all this madness.</p>
        <p>But you know what? I&rsquo;m alright with that. I&rsquo;ve always been alright with that. The first website I created that wasn&rsquo;t some Geocities piece of mess was a personal project I called Faded Leaf Design.</p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption>November 2001 &ndash; Splash screen for Faded Leaf design website that launched a popup window containing Flash documents. Looking back at this now I can&rsquo;t help but see a huge usability nightmare for visitors.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Over time I shifted focus and came up with Made Mistakes as a concept to wrap my online portfolio in. Originally I planned to create it in <del>Macromedia</del> Adobe Flash with a simple <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> backend. I quickly dropped that idea, inspired by the momentum gaining in the web standards movement around HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <p>After creating some static HTML pages to use as a framework, I settled on replicating the look and feel into <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. At the the time it was a popular <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> being used by other designers and made the most sense for realizing a gallery focused site with blog components.</p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption>Made Mistakes started in 2001 with a Flash teaser page and later morphed into a portfolio gallery powered by Movable Type.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now I want to see what I can do to enrich my eye and skills as a designer. I&rsquo;ve tired of all the constant reblogging of other&rsquo;s content without attribution or added insight, and feel that I owe it to myself to do more. I suppose the only way to grow is to create often and document the process and inspirations along the way.</p>
