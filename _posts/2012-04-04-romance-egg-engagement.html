<p>I&rsquo;ve always been one of those guys who didn&rsquo;t understand why women enjoyed receiving dead flowers. So two years ago when I decided to propose marriage to my girlfriend <a href="http://2littlerosebuds.com" target=_"blank">Wendy</a>, I was at a slight disadvantage &ndash; I&rsquo;m not a romantic, I don&rsquo;t do romance.</p>
<p>The ring was purchased, but the method of delivering it eluded me. Easter Sunday was quickly approaching and the idea of doing a scavenger hunt that ultimately led to the ring and me on one knee, popped in my head.</p>
<p>I wrote around ten clues that I sealed in plastic eggs and hid around our house the night before while Wendy showered. In the morning I woke her up, promising her a little diversion that she thought would end at an Easter basket full of <em>vegan treats</em>. At least that&rsquo;s what I alluded to, so she&rsquo;d get the hell out of bed!</p>
<p>Clue after clue, egg after egg, I led Wendy throughout the house until she found the last one&hellip;</p>

<p>I dropped to one knee, she dropped an F-bomb&hellip; and then said yes after realizing what just happened. Six months later, on October 2nd, 2010 we were married at <a href="http://www.roycroftinn.com" target="_blank"><em>The Roycroft Inn</em></a> in East Aurora, New York. Come this fall, we&rsquo;re expecting to double the size of our family with the arrival of the twins, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier!</p>
