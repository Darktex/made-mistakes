<p>Pretty much the only reason I created an About.me page was to get free customized business cards printed by Moo.</p>
<p>If you weren&rsquo;t aware &ndash; <a href="http://about.me">About.me</a> is a custom profile and personal analytics dashboard that lets you quickly build a personal page that points users to your content from around the web. Its straightforward <acronym title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> editor makes customizing the design, fonts, colors, and background image a breeze.</p>

    <figcaption>The QR code looks cool, but I doubt anyone actually scans these things.</figcaption>

<p>To take advantage of the <a href="http://about.me/offers/cards">free stack of business cards</a> (technically it&rsquo;s not free &ndash; shipping costs $5.50), just hit up the <em>offers section</em> in your About.me dashboard to place an order. You can import all your info and design elements or start from scratch and customize everything.</p>
