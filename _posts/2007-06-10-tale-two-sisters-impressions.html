<article class="content">
	<p>Netflix has been on a roll lately with the Korean films it&rsquo;s suggested I watch. First it was Chan-wook Park&rsquo;s three revenge flicks (<strong>Old Boy</strong>, <a title="Link to Sympathy for Mr Vengeance entry at IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0310775/"><strong>Sympathy for Mr Vengeance</strong></a>, and <a title="Link to Lady Vengeance entry at IMDb" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0451094/"><strong>Lady Vengeance</strong></a>) and now <a title="Link to A Tale of Two Sisters entry at IMDb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365376/"><strong>A Tale of Two Sisters</strong></a>.
	<p>Like most of the other Korean films &rsquo;ve seen, the story starts off really slow with most of the interesting and shocking events happening near the end. <strong>A Tale of Two Sisters</strong> really confused me right up until the end. The plot summary from Netflix leverages the horror and scary aspects of the film more than it should.</p>
	<blockquote><p>Terrified sisters try to exorcise their home of two dark forces &ndash; their evil stepmother and a vengeful entity &ndash; in this ghostly tale. Hospitalized after their mother&rsquo;s death, young Su-mi (Im Su-jeong) and Su-yeon (Mun Geun-yeong) return home to find a nasty new stepmother (Yeom Jeong-ah). The girls suffer terrifying events, but their father doesn&rsquo;t care, even though evil lurks around every corner. Can the girls free their home from its demons?</p></blockquote>
	<p>It really wasn&rsquo;t a horror film per say, but if you ever played those <strong>Fatal Frame</strong> videogames you&rsquo;ll probably recognize some familar imagery. Many of the scenes from the movie reminded me of the two sisters walking around the cursed village in <strong>Fatal Frame 2</strong>. There definitely were a few of those moments where you see something out of the corner of your eye and it freaks you out. Although the ghosts or whatever looked and acted like some of the creeps in <strong>The Ring</strong> and <strong>The Grude</strong>, this film was far from being on the level of those bad remakes.</p>
