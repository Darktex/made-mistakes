  	<h2>What Is This All About?</h2>
  	<p>So why the title &ldquo;made mistakes?&rdquo; It vaguely has something to do with that whole happy accident thing, where a mistake can turn out to be something great and unplanned. But to be honest I was just looking for a short memorable sounding domain name.</p>
  	<p>In May of 2004 I purchased mademistakes.com, and threw up a Macromedia Flash splash (hey remember those?) while I worked on building a design portfolio using Movable Type. For the next couple of years I would experiment with various content management systems (<a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> &rarr; <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> &rarr; <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.indexhibit.org/">Indexhibit</a>), developing minimalistic themes and learning what I could about <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, Javascript, and <abbr>PHP</abbr>.</p>
  	<p>I&rsquo;ve since decided to go <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>-free and manage everything using static text files that are converted into what you see here with the help of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Hand coding every page myself should give me greater control over each page&rsquo;s presentation and keep my HTML/CSS skills sharp in the process. Not being limited by a CMS is a wonderful thing&hellip;</p>
    <h2>And Who Are You Again?</h2>
  	<p>Oh hey. I&rsquo;m Michael Rose, just another boring, tattooed, time traveling, designer working in Buffalo, New York. I&rsquo;m into blind contour sketching on an iPad using <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper" target="_blank">Paper by FiftyThree</a>, movie theater popcorn, <a href="http://www.duffswings.com" title="Duff's Famous Wings" target="_blank">chicken wings done right</a>, dust collecting record collections, and over using ellipses and en-dashes.</p>
  	<p>Oh, and I'm a recent father of twin girls and will someday help redesign <a href="http://2littlerosebuds.wordpress.com" title="2 Little Rosebuds" target="_blank">my wife&rsquo;s blog</a>&hellip;</p>
