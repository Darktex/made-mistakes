	<h2>Who Are You?</h2>
	<p>Hi. I’m Michael Rose, just another boring, tattooed, time traveling, graphic designer from Buffalo, New York. I have too many vinyl records that I don’t recall buying, have no problem spending 99&cent; on interesting iOS games, enjoy eating movie theater popcorn more than seeing films, and over use ellipses and en-dashes in most of my writing.</p>
	<p>Oh, and soon to be father of twins&hellip;</p>

	<h2>What Is This All About?</h2>
	<p>So why the title &ldquo;made mistakes?&rdquo; It vaguely has something to do with that whole happy accident thing, where a mistake can turn out to be something great and unplanned. But to be honest I was just looking for memorable sounding domain name.</p>
	<p>In May of 2004 I purchased mademistakes.com, and threw up a splash page while I worked on building a design portfolio using <em>Movable Type</em>. For the next couple of years I would experiment with various content management systems (<a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> &rarr; <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> &rarr; <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> &rarr; <a href="http://www.indexhibit.org/">Indexhibit</a> &rarr; <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>), developing minimalistic themes and learning what I could about <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, Javascript, and <abbr>PHP</abbr>.</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;ve since decided to go <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>-free and manage the website using flat-static files, with the hope of having greater control over each page&rsquo;s presentation &ndash; <em>sup art directed blog posts?</em></p>
