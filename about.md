## What's a Made Mistakes?

So why the title "made mistakes? It vaguely has something to do with that whole happy accident thing, where a mistake can turn out to be something great and unplanned. But to be honest I was just looking for a short, memorable sounding domain name.

In May of 2004 I purchased mademistakes.com, and threw up a Macromedia Flash splash (hey remember those?) while I worked on building a design portfolio using Movable Type. For the next couple of years I would experiment with various content management systems ([Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) &rarr; [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com/) &rarr; [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) &rarr; [Indexhibit](http://www.indexhibit.org/)), developing minimalistic themes and learning what I could about <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, Javascript, <abbr>PHP</abbr>, and MySQL databases.

I've since decided to go <abbr>CMS</abbr>-free and utilize black magick and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [manage the site with static text files]({{ site.url }}/articles/going-static.html). I enjoy the control of hand coding every page and it helps keep my <abbr>HTML</abbr>/<abbr>CSS</abbr> skills sharp in the process. Not being limited by a <abbr>CMS</abbr> is a wonderful thing...

## And Who Are You Again?

Oh hey. I'm Michael Rose, just another boring, tattooed, time traveling, designer and illustrator working in Buffalo, New York. I'm into blind contour sketching on an iPad using [Paper by FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper), movie theater popcorn, [chicken wings done right](http://www.duffswings.com "Duff's Famous Wings"), dust collecting record collections, and over using ellipses and en-dashes.

Oh, and I'm a recent father of twin girls and will someday help redesign [my wife's blog](http://2littlerosebuds.com "2 Little Rosebuds")...
